<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Machine learning is an important research area and has become increasingly popular in various fields, such as security, engineering, sciences, finance, marketing, healthcare, and marketing. Machine learning covers a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and semisupervised tasks such as regression, classification, clustering, ensemble learning, and feature selection. Many issues or challenges, such as generalizability, interpretability, robustness, security, privacy, and data scarcity, require the development of new machine learning algorithms that can provide effective solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Evolutionary Computation (EC) includes a family of nature-inspired population-based algorithms/techniques, including Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Genetic Programming (GP). Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMO). EC techniques have promising global search ability to find high-quality solutions to problems without requiring rich domain knowledge and differential objective functions. EC techniques have been widely applied for many tasks in the fields of engineering, economics, finance, manufacturing, management, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multimodal optimization is a subfield of EC, which aims to develop veracious EC techniques with powerful search ability to find multiple (nearly) optimal solutions in a single run for an optimization problem. In many real-world scenarios, it is necessary to have multiple solutions with similar performance for better use. To find multiple solutions, many new strategies have been proposed in EC methods to enhance their global and local search ability, such as niching, parallel computing, multi-population, multitasking, etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In machine learning, there are many optimization problems requiring powerful search techniques. EC methods have also been widely applied to machine learning problems, including feature selection, ensemble combination, classifier generation, and parameter optimization. However, due to the different requirements in terms of model accuracy. complexity, interpretability, etc, it is valuable to find multiple solutions in machine learning, which are promising for future use. For example, in feature selection, if the methods can find multiple optimal feature subsets, the end users will have more choices in terms of which subset is more applicable based on different criteria. However, the potential of multimodal optimization for machine learning has not been comprehensively explored. It is necessary to develop new multimodal optimization approaches for machine learning.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Abstract: </b>Machine learning algorithms frequently involves optimization problems. Evolutionary algorithms have been investigated and applied to solve a number of practical problems. Therefore, it is natural to apply evolutionary algorithms to solve some selected machine learning problems. This talk will first briefly introduce some basic evolutionary algorithms. Subsequently, these algorithms will be applied to solve some machine learning problems such as clustering, feature selection, classification and so on. The talk will highlight potential challenges and how to overcome them. </span><span class="s4">聽</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Abstract: </b>This talk focuses on the synergistic use of evolutionary optimisation and machine learning techniques to enhance problem-solving in various domains. I will begin with an introduction to genetic programming (GP), an automated learning approach that exemplifies applied evolutionary machine learning. This segment will highlight recent advancements and applications, particularly in big data analytics and modeling, showcasing how GP can be effectively utilized to refine predictive accuracy and model robustness. Further, the presentation will cover the broader applications of evolutionary computation in optimizing complex and nonlinear systems across different fields, such as engineering. I will discuss the superior capabilities of these algorithms over traditional methods, particularly their adaptability and efficacy in handling large-scale and multi-objective optimization problems. Lastly, I will present case studies from my research, demonstrating the successful application of evolutionary in various scenarios. The discussion will also explore adaptable heuristics within evolutionary computation, which significantly enhance optimization outcomes, offering practical insights into their deployment in real-world settings.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Abstract: </b>Multiobjective optimization problems whose objectives have different evaluation costs are commonly seen in the real world. Such problems are now known as multiobjective optimization problems with heterogeneous objectives (HEMOPs). So far, however, only a few studies have been reported on addressing HE-MOPs, and most of them focus on biobjective problems with one fast objective and one slow objective. In this work, we aim to deal with HE-MOPs having more than two black-box and heterogeneous objectives. To this end, we develop a multiobjective Bayesian evolutionary optimization (BEO) approach to HE-MOPs that can alleviate search biases resulting from the different numbers of function evaluations allowed for the cheap and expensive objectives.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Abstract: </b>Evolutionary algorithms are highly effective for solving complex optimization problems, especially those involving multiple objectives. However, their significant computational demands and inherent stochasticity can slow down convergence to global optima, particularly in intricate scenarios. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to accelerate the convergence of complex multi-objective optimization problems through learning improvement representations. Our proposed methods involve training a neural model to learn performance improvement representations of solutions in various optimization contexts, including large-scale, dynamic, and constrained multi-objective optimization. By analyzing transitions between suboptimal and superior solutions, the model captures critical insights into performance improvements. We then design various learnable evolutionary generators guided by these learned improvement representations. These generators produce higher-quality offspring solutions by concurrently exploring the learned representation spaces. This approach accelerates the population</span><span class="s4">鈥檚</span><span class="s1"> convergence toward global optimality, steering the search process in more promising directions and enhancing overall efficiency.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Abstract: </b>Machine learning (ML) methods have obtained great success across a number of practical applications and attracted growing interest. How to improve learning performance has emerged as a prominent research area. In ML, the identification of multiple optimal or near-optimal solutions/models (i.e., multi-solution characteristics) is a common preference of many users. Examples include finding all possible structures in a protein prediction problem or providing multiple-diagnostic methods in disease prediction. In this talk, I will discuss how evolutionary computation methods especially niching techniques and multimodal multi-objective optimization are used to find multiple optimal or near-optimal solutions/models for a learning task. The multi-solution characteristics of a learning task is emphasized and analyzed. Also, our talk will discuss key challenges and provide insights into potential emerging directions in this field.</span></p>
